# Refactoring of Horiseon Page

# Intro

In this assignment, I refactored code that was provided for the Horiseon website using some of the standards learned in week 1 of our Coding bootcamp.

# Tasks completed

Some of the refactoring tasks completed were:

1. Consolidation of css selectors that were essentially duplicates
2. A broken hyperlink was resolved
3. Div tags were replaced with semantic HTML elements
4. Comments were added to HTML and CSS files
5. Added alt attributes to images
